# Hike Slovakia
_“To walk in nature is to witness a thousand miracles.” - Mary Davis_

The app was built as my fourth milestone project for Diploma in Full Stack Software Development with Code Institute. 

Hike Slovakia is a multi-page eCommerce web application for both visitors of and people living in Slovakia who wish to explore the country and its beautiful hiking destinations. The website offers its users a chance to book onto guided hikes in the region.

You can view the live website [here]( "Hike Slovakia").
